The goal of worldle is to be able to play a game of guessing a country based on its shape.

## Installation

You can install the development version of worldle like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("Stat585-at-ISU/worldle")
```

## Example

How do you play?

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(worldle)
## basic example code
play_worldle() 
```

You will be shown a shapefile of a country, you have to guess by typing in the name of a country.
See whether you can guess it!



Get the shapefile of a country:
```{r eval=FALSE}
url <- "https://geodata.ucdavis.edu/gadm/gadm4.1/shp/gadm41_AUT_shp.zip"
austria <- get_shapes(url)
austria <- thin(austria, 0.001)
```

Now plot the country: 
```{r}
data(austria)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

austria %>% ggplot() + geom_sf() + theme_void()
```

Would you have guessed that this is Austria?
